    "# Multi-Curve Framework in Interest Rate Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-curve framework has become the industry standard for pricing interest rate derivatives and managing risk. This approach emerged after the 2008 financial crisis, as market realities revealed significant differences between various reference rates. In this note, we discuss the theory behind multi-curve modeling, why it is used, and its mathematical formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Why Use a Multi-Curve Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, a single yield curve was used for both discounting cash flows and forecasting future rates. However, market conditions revealed that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Different Rates for Different Purposes:**  \n",
    "  - The **Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS)** curve better reflects the risk-free (or collateralized) funding rate and is used for discounting cash flows.\n",
    "  - **LIBOR, EURIBOR, or other interbank rates** are used for forecasting future floating rates.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Basis Spreads:**  \n",
    "  The spreads (or differences) between these rates, known as basis spreads, are non-zero and vary across tenors. Ignoring these differences can lead to mispricing of instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a **multi-curve framework** separates:\n",
    "- The **discount curve** (often built from OIS rates)\n",
    "- The **forward (forecast) curve(s)** (built from LIBOR, EURIBOR, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation provides a more realistic and accurate model for derivative pricing and risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Discount Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The discount factor \\( P(0,T) \\) for cash flow at time \\( T \\) is computed using the continuously compounded risk-free rate \\( r(T) \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(0,T) = e^{-r(T) \\, T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This discount curve is typically bootstrapped from market instruments such as OIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Forward Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward rate \\( F(t, T) \\) for a given period \\([T, T+\\Delta]\\) is derived from the forward curve. If \\( P^{\\text{Frd}}(0,T) \\) denotes the discount factor from the forward curve, then the forward rate is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(0; T, T+\\Delta) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left( \\frac{P^{\\text{Frd}}(0,T)}{P^{\\text{Frd}}(0,T+\\Delta)} - 1 \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \\(\\Delta\\) is the accrual period (e.g., 0.25 for a 3-month period).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Basis Spread\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis spread \\( S(T) \\) accounts for the difference between the forecasting rate (e.g., LIBOR) and the risk-free (OIS) rate. It can be modeled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_{\\text{LIBOR}}(0; T, T+\\Delta) = F_{\\text{OIS}}(0; T, T+\\Delta) + S(T)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( F_{\\text{LIBOR}}(0; T, T+\\Delta) \\) is the forward rate implied by LIBOR.\n",
    "- \\( F_{\\text{OIS}}(0; T, T+\\Delta) \\) is the forward rate implied by the OIS discount curve.\n",
    "- \\( S(T) \\) is the basis spread at time \\( T \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Pricing Derivatives in a Multi-Curve Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an interest rate swap where a fixed rate \\( K \\) is exchanged for a floating rate. In a multi-curve setting, the floating rate is forecast using the forward curve, and all cash flows are discounted using the OIS (discount) curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present value \\( V_{\\text{swap}} \\) of a payer swap can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{\\text{swap}} = \\text{notional} \\times \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\tau_j \\, P^{\\text{Discount}}(0, T_j) \\left( F(0; T_{j-1}, T_j) - K \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( \\tau_j \\) is the accrual factor for period \\( j \\),\n",
    "- \\( P^{\\text{Discount}}(0, T_j) \\) is the discount factor from the OIS curve,\n",
    "- \\( F(0; T_{j-1}, T_j) \\) is the forward rate from the forward curve,\n",
    "- \\( K \\) is the fixed rate (strike).\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula ensures that the forecasting and discounting processes are handled by the appropriate curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bootstrap the Discount Curve:**  \n",
    "   - Use OIS instruments to calibrate the discount curve.\n",
    "   - Compute \\( P^{\\text{Discount}}(0,T) = e^{-r(T) T} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Construct the Forward Curve:**  \n",
    "   - Use market instruments (e.g., LIBOR-based swaps) to build the forward curve.\n",
    "   - Derive forward rates using the relationship:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     F(0; T, T+\\Delta) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left( \\frac{P^{\\text{Frd}}(0,T)}{P^{\\text{Frd}}(0,T+\\Delta)} - 1 \\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calibrate Basis Spreads:**  \n",
    "   - Compare the forward rates from the forward curve with those implied by the discount curve.\n",
    "   - Adjust for the basis spread \\( S(T) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Price Derivatives:**  \n",
    "   - For each cash flow, forecast the floating rate using the forward curve.\n",
    "   - Discount the cash flow using the discount curve.\n",
    "   - Sum the present values to get the derivative price.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Benefits of the Multi-Curve Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy:**  \n",
    "  Reflects the market-observed differences between various rates (e.g., OIS vs. LIBOR).\n",
    "- **Risk Management:**  \n",
    "  Allows for better hedging by modeling basis risk explicitly.\n",
    "- **Market Consistency:**  \n",
    "  Provides a pricing methodology that is consistent with the collateralization and funding practices seen in the market.\n",
